# GIFBot
GIFBot is an interactive Twitch bot written by twitch.tv/fiercekittenz and has been in development since early-2016. It is an ASP.NET application with a Blazor WASM front-end. As a caveat, this is a personal project developed in my fleeting spare time.

## Planning and Future Releases
I currently track tasks for each release as well as the backlog on Trello: https://trello.com/b/KMmvrIgA/gifbot-r

## Contributing
If you wish to help with GIFBot, you will need a license for the Progress Telerik Blazor UI Components. They are provided courtesy of Progress Telerik and make up the bulk of the client-side.
